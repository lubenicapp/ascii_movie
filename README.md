Hello

This is a toy project.

This python script downloads a video from youtube and plays it in the terminal as ascii art

It is extremely inefficient, I advise you try it with a very short video first like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwcPjjN-KWs)

I might improve it later, even make something serious out of it

# Installation

install dependencies from Pipfile with something like `pipenv install`, preferably in a virtual env
or `pip install -r requirements.txt` (have not tested it)

# Usage

open a terminal make it full screen. set police size to something small if possible.

my terminal display is 61*237 and it is decent.

then run:

``` 
python play.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwcPjjN-KWs
```
